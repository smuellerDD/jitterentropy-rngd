# Systemd configuration file

# The Jitterentropy RNGd does not depend on any other system
# services. Futhermore, we want to start it as early as possible
# in the boot cycle so that other services requiring
# random numbers (like SSHD, TLS-based services) benefit
# from a properly seeded /dev/?random
